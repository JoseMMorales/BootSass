# Description
Who would like to use CSS Superpower?? Just implement your website with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I gave it a shot with my bootstrap project and I fell in love with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), as this is a really good practice of how to organize your CSS for different pages and features. I sticked to the basic level of Sass which is incrementing efficiency re-using mixins, assigning variables, creating Partials and building nesting trees for a clear understanding on how my stylesheets work. 

## Further clarification of Basics:

* Variables: Variables are used to store data, you may save whatever value would be needed (even units). They use $ sign to identify and assign.

* Mixins: A mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused for different reasons. You also can pass parameters to share themm all by element in your website.

* Partials: Contains CSS code specifically for a feature, page or sections. This makes CSS easy to maintain when you need to update or even fix any piece of CSS.

* Nesting: You will be able to nest your CSS code from parents to children adding styles ordering by hierarchy. & sign are very common when adding different selectors like Hover, Visited, etc...
